## Overview

This Constellation DAO (CXND) improvement proposal endeavors to implement a mechanism for the DAO to reward its members for their contributions & efforts that build value for the DAO, its members, and the Constellation Fund (CXNF). The web3-native term for these incentives is “bounties”, as further defined below.

This Constellation DAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) will set a loose framework for an incentivized bounty system in CXND with a small allocation of five thousand (5,000) $CXN tokens for each permanent committee (Governance, Programs, & Treasury). 

## Background & Motivation

Bounties are a prevalent form of compensation in the world of DAOs and Web 3. They exist along a spectrum, from small routine tasks and pull requests to significant, multi-staged projects. But all bounties share a common goal – to incentivize members to contribute their time and talent to increase the value of the DAO in exchange for increased voting power.

This CIP strives to lay the groundwork for more substantial discussions about compensation within the DAO. As such, it is left quite broad and open-ended to allow for a reasonable amount of experimentation. 

### Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

  - Experiment with ways to Incentivize members to build value in CXND through rewards for contribution. 
  - Define what a bounty is & the types of bounties available for creation.
  - Allocate a nominal amount of $CXN tokens to each permanent committee to utilize

**Non-goals**

  - Develop an operational framework that bounties will follow.
  - Assign a value of $CXN to bounties.
  - Finalize the specifications of a bounty & the responsibilities of bounty authors, CXND members, and committees.

## Proposed Solution

### Definitions

**Bounty:**

  - A reward granted to a community member in exchange for completing a task or project that adds value to the DAO. It is explicitly not remuneration for assigned roles, such as serving on a committee.

**Bounty Origins:**

  - _DAO Created_ - Representatives of the DAO identify a need and clearly articulate the project's scope and associated award. For the purposes of this CIP, this will be the responsibility of the three permanent committees.
  - _Member Driven_ - CXN members may draft a bounty proposal and submit it for review from the community. These can be from members identifying a need or based on areas of interest identified by the committees.

**Bounty Lifecycle:**

1. An opportunity to add value to the DAO is identified.
2. A post is drafted articulating the specifics of the task and bounty. These are suggestions and not prescriptive. Please experiment and iterate.
    - A high-level overview of the bounty. Outline the purpse. 
    - Mission/Requirements - Clearly define what excellence/success looks like and who will review the finished product.
    - Compensation - Be clear and explicit. Examples help.
3. The bounty is posted to Dework.
4. A community member claims the bounty, or in some instances, is approved to work on the bounty.
5. Upon completion, the reviewer can ask for further revisions or mark it as complete and approve compensation.
6. For some small bounties, payment may happen automatically, and in other instances, payment will be batch processed with other bounties by the Treasury Committee.

### Plan & Timeline

The Dework platform has already been established along with some early projects & bounty ideas input by the permanent committees. Work on Dework’s organizational structure & use will be updated & changed as time goes on. This CIP will be implemented immediately after CIP approval and will run for the remaining length of CXND’s Season 1. 

The permanent committees will manage the bounty system with feedback from all members of CXND. Each permanent committee will be responsible for creating bounties & determining a unified approval process. The Treasury committee will distribute approved $CXN token allotments. Reviews of progress may occur both in bi-weekly town halls and ad hoc meetings that will be public, and all CXND members are encouraged to participate. 

Only $CXN tokens will be used for Season 1’s bounty pilot though future bounties may utilize other compensation, such as stablecoins and other virtual currencies.

### Dependencies

**Committees**

  - a. This initial phase will allocate five thousand (5,000) $CXN tokens to each committee for Season 1, allowing them to develop their own bounties, learn, and quickly iterate on the process.

  - b. Committee members are ineligible to perform bounties posted by their own committee.

  - c. Unallocated $CXN will roll over and be deducted from the next season’s budget.

**Treasury Committee**

  - a. The Treasury Committee will have ultimate responsibility for authorizing and making the bounty payments.

**Dework**

  - a. CXN DAO will utilize the Dework platform for the entire bounty lifecycle.

  - b. Dework has become the industry standard, and there are countless examples we can reference for best practices.

**Xpand Gaming**

  - a. CXN DAO will use the Xpand platform to administer small community engagement awards, such as engaging with content on Twitter and Discord.

### Rationale

The initial design of the CXN DAO bounty program is intentionally succinct and open-ended to allow space for experimentation. DAO bounties are a novel approach to organizing labor, and communities have unique cultures and requirements that will influence the design of their programs.

Several bounty programs studied allow non-members to enter the community and claim and execute bounties, which demand a much more structured and top-down approach. CXN DAO bounties will only be available to DAO members who hold their membership NFT for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our design space is much more open, and we can and should allow for grassroots community input into the design and implementation of the bounty program.

### Risks?

Because this CIP is focused on experimentation, failure of the CIP will only lead to the distribution of a small amount of $CXN tokens into the DAO community. Risk is being managed through the limitation of available tokens in this bounty pilot specifically to learn about the process of bounties in CXND’s community – to understand what does and does not work. 

In terms of bounties, there is a risk that no one participates & the process of using tools such as Dework is not as useful as the authors of this CIP thought. However, with this being a learning process, the only “failure” would be not trying at all.
