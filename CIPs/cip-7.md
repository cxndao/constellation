## Overview

This Constellation DAO (CXND) improvement proposal defines the basic concept and functionality of a bounty along with its associated components and implementations. A bounty is an incentive mechanism that compensates Constellation DAO (CXND) members for their contributions & efforts that help build value for the entire DAO, its members, and the Constellation Fund (CXNF). 

This Constellation DAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) will set a loose framework for an incentivized bounty system in CXND with a small allocation of 5,000 $CXN tokens for each permanent committee (Governance, Programs, & Treasury). 

## Background & Motivation

Bounties are a prevalent form of compensation in the world of DAOs and Web 3. They exist along a spectrum, from small routine tasks and pull requests to significant, multi-staged projects. Accordingly, bounties can be listed on a permissionless task board any member can access and choose to execute, to the other extreme where jobs are restricted to members with particular skills or roles and may also require an application and approval process. But all bounties share a common goal – to incentivize members to contribute their time and talent to increase the value of the DAO in exchange for increased voting power.

This CIP strives to lay the groundwork for more substantial discussions about compensation within the DAO. As such, it is left quite broad and open-ended to allow for a reasonable amount of experimentation. 

### Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

  - Experiment with ways to Incentivize members to build value in CXND through rewards for contribution. 
  - Define what a bounty is & the types of bounties available for creation.
  - Allocate a small amount of $CXN tokens to each permanent committee to utilize

**Non-goals**

  - Develop an operational framework that bounties will follow.
  - Assign a value of $CXN to bounties.
  - Finalize the specifications of a bounty & the responsibilities of bounty authors, CXND members, and committees.

## Proposed Solution

### Plan & Timeline

The Dework platform has already been established along with some early projects & bounty ideas input by the permanent committees. Work on Dework’s organizational structure & use will be updated & changed as time goes on. This CIP will be implemented immediately after CIP approval and will run for the remaining length of CXND’s Season 1. 

The permanent committees will manage the bounty system with feedback from all members of CXND. Each permanent committee will be responsible for creating bounties & determining a unified approval process. The Treasury committee will distribute approved $CXN token allotments. Reviews of progress may occur both in bi-weekly town halls and ad hoc meetings that will be public, and all CXND members are encouraged to participate. 

Only $CXN tokens will be used for Season 1’s bounty pilot though future bounties may utilize other compensation, such as stablecoins and other virtual currencies.

### Dependencies

**Committees**

  - a. This initial phase will allocate five thousand (5,000) $CXN tokens to each committee for Season 1, allowing them to develop their own bounties, learn, and quickly iterate on the process.

  - b. Committee members are ineligible to perform bounties posted by their own committee.

  - c. Unallocated $CXN will roll over and be deducted from the next season’s budget.

**Treasury Committee**

  - a. The Treasury Committee will have ultimate responsibility for authorizing and making the bounty payments.

**Dework**

  - a. CXN DAO will utilize the Dework platform for the entire bounty lifecycle.

  - b. Dework has become the industry standard, and there are countless examples we can reference for best practices.

**Xpand Gaming**

  - a. CXN DAO will use the Xpand platform to administer small community engagement awards, such as engaging with content on Twitter and Discord.

### Rationale

The initial design of the CXN DAO bounty program is intentionally succinct and open-ended to allow space for experimentation. DAO bounties are a novel approach to organizing labor, and communities have unique cultures and requirements that will influence the design of their programs.

Several bounty programs studied allow non-members to enter the community and claim and execute bounties, which demand a much more structured and top-down approach. CXN DAO bounties will only be available to DAO members who hold their membership NFT for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our design space is much more open, and we can and should allow for grassroots community input into the design and implementation of the bounty program.

### Risks?

Because this CIP is focused on experimentation, failure of the CIP will only lead to the distribution of a small amount of $CXN tokens into the DAO community. Risk is being managed through the limitation of available tokens in this bounty pilot specifically to learn about the process of bounties in CXND’s community – to understand what does and does not work. 

In terms of bounties, there is a risk that no one participates & the process of using tools such as Dework is not as useful as the authors of this CIP thought. However, with this being a learning process, the only “failure” would be not trying at all.
