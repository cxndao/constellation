## Overview

Constellation Fund (“Fund” or “CXNF”) is an independent venture investment company created to support Constellation DAO (“CXND” or “DAO”). It is run by the Sponsors of this proposal who serve as the Investment Committee members and General Partners of the Fund. For reasons of compliance, the DAO is a separate, arms-length entity that provides services to the Fund in exchange for Carried Interest. This proposal establishes a partnership agreement between the DAO (and its future entities) and the Fund to fund the DAO’s treasury.

The Fund is planning to initiate fundraising in early Q3/Q4-2022. CXNF is launching as a one-of-a-kind VC fund that has a strategic partnership with Constellation DAO, which provides it a significant competitive advantage in relation to sourcing and all the steps in-between that and ultimately exit.

As part of the fundraising strategy, potential limited partners will be offered $CXN tokens as an additional return kicker (with potential to earn more $CXN tokens via DAO contributions), which we believe will drive potential additional engagement touchpoints for CXND and ultimately expand the overall network.

## Background & Motivation

The success of Constellation Fund provides significant benefits to Constellation DAO, including the following:
  - Enhanced press and media coverage, allowing for increasing member growth
  - CXND member engagement, allowing for member retention via aligned incentives. $CXN tokens will be utilized to incentivize members members of CXND to partake in the investment activities of CXND / CXNF
  - Carried Interest provides a base level of value for $CXN token (see table below for sensitivity analysis)

### Goals / Non-goals

- **Goals**
  - The ultimate goal is to align the relationship between the DAO and the Fund by way of $CXN tokens, which ultimately results in value contributed to the token itself (both tangible and intangible).

- **Non-goals**
  - The proposal is not seeking to specifically outline the exact mechanics for the ongoing relationship following the initial issuance and establishment of it. The specifics will be provided via a new CIP in the coming near future.

## Proposed Solution

Issue 20,000,000 million $CXN tokens to Constellation Fund to facilitate the general fundraising and

In exchange for 20% of total $CXN tokens (or 20,000,000 $CXN tokens) to be distributed to CXNF (vesting schedule below), CXND will receive the Carried Interest (“CI”) of CXNF, which is defined as: 20.0% of the amount of return in excess of 2.0x contributed capital. Any taxes required to be paid by the CXNF GPs for transferring this amount will reduce the Carried Interest before it is sent to the DAO.

Vesting schedule for the $CXN tokens received by CXNF shall be 4,000,000 tokens per annum (with monthly vesting) for a period of five (5) years.

### Plan & Timeline

Approval of the CIP is required in order to launch the fundraising process as $CXN tokens will be an important component of the fundraising strategy. The ultimately success of the fundraising will have benefits to the DAO as outlined in the “Background & Motivation” section.

### Dependencies

Fundraising is a key dependency, which will be impacted by macroeconomic factors that are outside of the control of any individual and/or group. However, specific micro factor dependencies would include the ability to provide $CXN token incentives to potential limited partners and therefore approval of this proposal is a key dependency.

### Rationale

The sizing of the token issuance is based on precedent cases, such as Orange DAO / Orange Fund. The specifications around vesting schedule is also based on this precedent case.

Despite the broad stroke similarities, CXNF is unique in that the $CXN tokens will confer to the DAO added benefits via expanded network (LPs who will be receiving benefits and therefore potentially invested in the success of the DAO outside of just the Fund) and recycling of $CXN tokens to the DAO as part of ongoing relationship building between the Fund and the DAO.
