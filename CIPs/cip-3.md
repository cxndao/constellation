## Overview

Current, non-Genesis members of Constellation DAO (CXND) who joined during Season 0 should receive $CXN tokens for their verified membership. Each $CXN token represents one vote in CXND's voting matters. Genesis members are defined as members who signed the charter before 04/27/2022. Season 0 members are those that joined and received their membership NFT between 04/28/2022 and the seasonâ€™s end on 10/26/2022. 

## Background & Motivation

Season 0 members are considered vitally important, analogous to the importance of the first hires of a startup. Because of this, Season 0 members are still considered early and different than new members of future seasons. Because of this, Season 0 members deserve a different token distribution not tied to the future season distribution rate. 

There are two different opportunities for distribution, looking at different distribution rates based on different arguments. 

### Goals

- **Goals**
  - Decide on a token distribution rate based on the Genesis member initial token distribution. 
  - Distribute tokens to all existing and future Season 0 members that are verified with their NFT. 

- **Non-goals**
  - Setting a distribution rate for Season 1 and future seasons. Another CIP will focus on future seasons. 
  - Setting up the process to distribute the $CXN tokens. This will rely on the Treasury committee & will follow precedent of the token distribution to Genesis members. 

## Proposed Solution

Per the Constellation DAO Charter, two million $CXN tokens were allotted to Genesis members, to be equally distributed to all members that signed the Charter prior to the deadline. This resulted in all Genesis members receiving 23,255 tokens, each. This number of tokens will be used as the membership token allotment baseline. 

For current and future Season 0 members verified with their NFT, these new CXND members will receive token amounts based on the following distribution rate. These tokens will come from the treasury token pool, not the season token pool. 

Genesis members received an airdrop of $23,255$ $CXN tokens. Season 0 members can receive tokens based on two different distribution rates of that baseline.

| Option | Rate  | $CXN Amount |
| :----: | :---: | :---------: | 
| `1`    | 100%  | 23,255      |
| `2`    | 77%   | 17,906      |

During the voting of this CIP, CXND members will be able to select from the `two` options or they may choose to abstain from the vote. 

### Plan & Timeline

After the vote, the Treasury Committee will send tokens to all new and NFT verified Season 0 joined members. 

### Dependencies

None

### Rationale

We need to incentivize new Season 0 members to participate in CXN governance and help push forward new CIPs & engagement. 

### Risks?

None
