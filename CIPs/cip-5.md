## Overview

The Fund is an independent venture investment company created to support Constellation DAO (“CXND” or “DAO”). It is run by the Sponsors of this proposal who serve as the Investment Committee members and General Partners of the Fund. For reasons of compliance, the DAO is a separate, arms-length entity that provides services to the Fund in exchange for Carried Interest (defined in prior approved proposal [CIP-2](https://github.com/cxndao/constellation/blob/97defa859b8a83206465f2d441052154a1232a84/CIPs/cip-2.md)). This proposal establishes a partnership agreement between the DAO (and its future entities) and the Fund.

Constellation DAO and its members are uniquely qualified to provide due diligence and investment support to Constellation Fund. In order to unlock maximum synergies of the relationship between CXND and CXNF, the orderly working of the Constellation DAO Venture Capital Team (“CXND VC Team”) is required as a key component.

In order to ensure that CXND and CXNF work together in a mutually beneficial manner, it will require structured processes and procedures, templates, expectation management, and proper incentive structure.

## Background & Motivation

We are aiming to decentralize many of the centralized processes in the VC investment process today, harnessing the intellectual firepower and experiences of the collective DAO members. We believe that the wisdom of the crowds provides enormous value in assessing investment opportunities, drawing upon local knowledge, first-hand experience, domain expertise, and unique insights, which may result in superior outcomes.

**Benefits:**

Increase overall engagement of CXND members by providing opportunities to potentially work with founders (initially at investment stage, but also into the Portfolio Management stage)
With increasing investments made, expect increased press and media coverage, which should inure to the benefit of CXND member growth and retention
As CXND is the ultimate beneficiary of the carried interest of CXNF, financial benefit to manifest in the value of the $CXN token 

### Goals / Non-goals
- **Goals**
  - (1) Decentralize traditional VC investment process 
  - (2) Establish framework for working relationship between CXNF and CXND 
  - (3) Increase engagement and allow for the DAO’s members to contribute based on their area of expertise 
- **Non-goals**
  - (1) Portfolio management (post-investment) framework is not opined on as part of this proposal 
  - (2) Outsource decision-making to the DAO, with DAO providing due diligence support 

## Proposed Solution

In order to ensure that CXND and CXNF work together in a mutually beneficial manner, it will require structured processes and procedures, templates and expectation management and proper incentive structure.

The CXND VC Team can and may have various functions to assist CXNF (and ultimately CXND itself) on potential investments, including the following:
- Sourcing
- Due Diligence *
- Capital Markets / Fundraising
- Operations
- Portfolio Management
- CXND Advisory Panel * (For the avoidance of doubt, CXNF ultimately will have final say on all investment decisions)

_For purposes of this proposal, we will focus on Due Diligence and CXND Advisory Panel activity, with other areas to be covered at a later date and via a new written proposal (CIP tbd)._

**Pre-Due Diligence**

It is envisioned that all opportunities would be submitted into Constellation Fund via its website (cxn.fund) through the appropriate link. Even for deals that are being referred via a member of CXND, we would request that the member direct the company/project to the appropriate CXNF website. As part of completing the initial “Apply For Funding” application, the referral source will be requested and thus will be tracked.

We also envision that a summary of the application will be provided to all members of the CXND VC Team in the appropriate Discord channel to provide initial feedback via an emoji-based tallying system.  Based on the tally, this will provide CXNF with inputs as it decides on whether or not to progress the opportunity to the Due Diligence stage.

**Due Diligence**

CXND VC Team will provide due diligence support and related documentation for all parts of the investment process from beginning to ultimately an investment being made. Required work product from the team would include the following (template to be provided at appropriate time):
Initial Screening Memo (#1): to be drafted and submitted to the CXND Advisory Panel (see further herein) at initial evaluation stage of any given project, company, or opportunity (“Deals”)
Follow Up Memo (#2)(if applicable): for Deals that proceed, there will likely be areas for further diligence, which will require the team to research / Q&A management or other sources and produce a memo to submit to the CXND Advisory Panel
Investment Memo (#3): for Deals that continue to the investment stage, the team would be required to provide a summary of final terms (as part of assisting in negotiating terms) and other admin details in memo form and submit to the CXND Advisory Panel  

Further framework to be developed as it relates to Deal team formation and composition. However, we do expect that Deal teams will naturally come together as part of the decentralized process of due diligence, whereby members of the DAO with relevant experience and expertise contribute towards the investment process. Per each Deal, we do intend to have a Deal team lead, which will either be the referrer and/or a nominated member or group.
 
**CXND Advisory Panel**

A select group of CXND VC Team will be selected to participate in the CXND Advisory Panel, and effectively act as the voting group as it relates to the attractiveness of any particular Deal proposed for investment. 

Members of the CXND Advisory Panel will provide feedback at each stage of the investment evaluation process in the form of written comments, emoji voting system (more details to come) and/or other means of communication to provide feedback / insights.

Further framework to be developed as it relates to member selection and other potential responsibilities the panel may have as it relates to shepherding of the investment evaluation process.

**Process Workflow Overview**

Tokens Request - 401,000 $CXN tokens in total 

Pre Due Diligence - Token Request - 75,000 $CXN tokens
- A pool of 15 $CXN tokens per opportunity, with estimated time spent of 10 minutes
- 5,000 total opportunities screened and tallied

Due Diligence - Token Request - 286,000 $CXN tokens
(Note, the assumptions around $CXN token calculation provided to help formulate and justify the total pool of tokens available per #1, #2 (if applicable), and #3. Note that ultimate distribution of $CXN tokens to CXND contributors will be dependent upon an assessment of contribution per task. However, to be clear, the pool of $CXN tokens is fixed per #1, #2, and #3 tasks.)

- Initial Screening Memo (#1): 250,000 $CXN tokens (500 $CXN tokens / Deal)
  - [100] $CXN tokens per hour rate
  - [2.5] hours assumption to complete
  - 2 pax Deal team
  - 500 total Deals screened

- Follow Up Memo (#2): 25,000 $CXN tokens (500 $CXN tokens / Deal)
  - [125] $CXN tokens per hour rate
  - [2.0] hours assumption to complete
  - 2 pax Deal team
  - 50 total Deals to Follow Up

- Investment Memo (#3): 6,000 $CXN tokens (600 $CXN tokens / Deal)
  - [150] $CXN tokens per hour rate
  - [2.0] hours assumption to complete
  - 2 pax Deal team
  - 10 total Deals to Investment stage

- Investment Bonus (A): 5,000 $CXN tokens
  - Additional 500 $CXN tokens for each Investment made
  - Maximum of 10 total deals
  - Also serves as a variance balancing factor should any components above have a longer than expected duration

- CXND Advisory Panel / Investment Committee Activity - Token Request -  40,000 $CXN tokens

- 5 member committee to be renewed upon each new Cohort.  Each member shall be rewarded at the end of each successful Cohort with 8,000 $CXN tokens.

- Prior to the start of a new Cohort, the $CXN token rates and allocations to be reviewed and agreed upon, accounting for any new learnings in prior Cohort processes.

**Constellation Fund Rebate** 

The purpose of CXNF Rebate is to provide CXND additional tokens to provide the CXND VC Team performance token incentives.

At the end of each Cohort, CXNF shall pay $CXN tokens to CXND in the amounts representing the aggregate amount of $CXN tokens paid with respect to the Investment Bonus (A) and CXND Advisory Panel.  Specifically as it relates to this proposal, and for the avoidance of doubt, the amount to be remitted to CXND from CXNF would be 45,000 $CXN tokens (“CXND Rebate”).

Furthermore, should CXNF invest in at least 10 Deals, CXNF shall remit an additional amount of tokens equal to 15,000 $CXN tokens, aggregating to a total of 60,000 $CXN tokens in relation to this proposal.

### Plan & Timeline

**Start:** Upon approval and upon completion of CXNF fundraising

**End:** Expected, 1 Cohort (~1 year) or 2 CXND Seasons

Execution of the implementation of the overall process is work in progress as it relates to templates and system integrations (typeform, airtable, discord, etc). We aim to have the process fully tested and implemented prior to the completion of the CXNF fundraising. Note that this proposal is for the first cohort (1 year) and we expect to refine the next proposals in relation to this process.

### Dependencies

As noted in the diagrams and in the Plan & Timeline, there will be external dependencies as it relates to software tools, with integrations. However, these do not require significant technology build-outs or enhancements and can be addressed via the existing platforms we intend to use. There may be manual elements required to ensure smooth overall processing, but we endeavor to create as much automation as possible.

### Rationale

The current plan design was carefully thought through, with an overall goal of innovating on the current traditional VC investment paradigm. We initially approach it from a more traditional VC investment perspective, with the key feature being dedicated Deal teams, which we believe could work but would limit the contributions from the DAO as a whole. Therefore, we ideated what we believe to be a better way, which decentralizes the investment process, allowing for all DAO members to contribute (should they believe they are qualified in certain areas or elements of the process) and be incentivized for their direct contributions. As noted above, we do believe that the collective, when working together, can achieve more than any individual or designated group of individuals.

### Risks?

While we do not believe that members of the DAO would lack experience or expertise, this is always a possibility. Furthermore, there is a risk around general engagement from the DAO in participating in this process. And while we believe that the token incentive design is appropriate, there is also a risk that it may not be.

The resulting impact of the above would be that there is a severe disruption to the overall investment process for CXNF and potentially hinders ability to react to the many investment opportunities that is likely to befall it. While it may be the case that the investment process as proposed may be disrupted, we believe that CXNF will be able to carry on without the DAO. And while we believe that CXNF could generate satisfactory returns, there may be missed opportunities without contributions from CXND.

As it relates to token incentive structure, as mentioned earlier, we note that this is the first step in an interactive process, with this proposal covering the term of one cohort (1 year). As we learn from this initial process, the next proposal is likely to incorporate learnings for the next season.
