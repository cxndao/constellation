## Overview
Certain members of CXND recently launched a cross country event to promote the DAO with the objective to increase awareness and membership (“Cross Country Tour”). The Cross Country Tour began in Hong Kong and has taken place in New York and Miami.  The next stops will be Austin, Seattle, San Francisco and Oakland (FounderCon).
To enhance the outcome of the Cross Country Tour, primarily measured by member growth, the use of POAPs, $CXN tokens, and cash as a collective incentive mechanism would aid this outcome.
## Background & Motivation

Ultimately we believe that this proposal aims to increase both membership growth of the DAO via real-life engagement, which we believe will result in stronger engagement within the DAO overall from new members that come in via a real-life connection.
Benefits to the DAO:
Increasing membership of the DAO
Increasing engagement, activity, and participation amongst existing and new potential CXND members
While experimental, testing a refer-and-earn model for membership growth and engagement
While experimental, initiating potential use case for POAPs, with this being a launchpad for further exploration around new incentive mechanisms
### Goals / Non-goals

- **Goals**
- To increase the overall membership of Constellation DAO
- To increase engagement amongst Constellation DAO members via real-life events
- To enhance engagement with the use of POAPs

- **Non-goals**
- To determine engagement architectures
- To determine all use cases for the POAP

## Proposed Solution
The Cross Country Tour is an informal gathering of existing CXND members, Techstars alumni (not in the DAO), and current Techstars accelerator members. These events are meant to promote live engagement and exchange of ideas, grow interpersonal connections, general networking, with an overall goal of onboarding more CXND members.
As part of attendance recognition, each attendee has and will receive a uniquely-designed POAP that states the city of the event and a cool graphic logo that can be displayed in your POAP wallet app. Super-attendees are able to gather all POAPs (seven in total).
In addition to attendance recognition, we are proposing that any CXND member with a POAP _AND_ NFT be eligible to receive $CXN token incentives, which not only encourages general participation amongst the entire community, but also provides newly exposed persons to CXND to take the next step to mint their NFTs (See Incentive Scheme and Cash Prize Reimbursement section for more details).
Incentive Scheme & Cash Prize Reimbursement:
POAP Incentive Scheme
Live engagement by CXND members, whether amongst each other or with potential new members, is synergistic. There is significant momentum that is created amongst the community to mobilize, strategize, and proselytize, when there are live meetups and gatherings. The Cross Country Tour is one example of a start to continue this engagement amongst the community.
Specifically for the Cross Country Tour CXND members that receive POAP(s) and have a minted NFT, the proposal is to provide added $CXN token incentives to encourage more engagement (e.g. attend as many events as possible) but also encourage exploration of the $CXN token itself. With each new member that is added, an expectation is that those added as part of the Cross Country Tour will bring fresh ideas, new perspectives, and a broader range of voices to the collective to increase the value of CXND itself, ensuring the benefit of $CXN tokenholders ultimately.

Cross Country Tour Referral Bonus:
For any CXND members that refers members during the Cross Country Tour period, resulting in existing or new members holding a POAP and minted NFT, will earn [25] $CXN Tokens per new member. Note, the referral mechanism will require added input by reference at time of sign up, which will be the responsibility of the referrer to ensure referral incentive is earned.  
Additional Background Information Cash Prize Reimbursement
Certain members of CXND are putting up a cash incentive in the form of a cash prize raffle to incentivize Cross Country Tour attendance and NFT minting. The basic premise is that a cash prize will be given to a randomly selected member of the DAO that has a POAP and minted NFT. The current cash prize that is being contemplated is a maximum of $1,000 USD (ONE THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) and to be delivered to the member by the end of FounderCon (in cash or via USDC or other means as necessary/required) (“Cash Prize Incentive”). 
All members of CXND who wish to participate in the funding of this Cash Prize Incentive, please reach out to the Sponsor and/or Proposers for further details.
Reimbursement Scheme:
Upon CXND raising funding for community growth and expansion that is of sufficient size and scale, CXND shall reimburse all CXND members that participated in the Cash Prize Incentive based on their contribution. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cash Prize Incentive is not a loan or any form of debt obligation or legal liability whatsoever of CXND.
Additionally, for Cash Prize Incentive participating CXND members, they shall receive in aggregate as a group [1] $CXN token per $1 USD contributed. For the avoidance of doubt, token distribution related to the Cash Prize Incentive is completely arbitrary, is not a form of interest cost, upfront fee or a fee, or borrowing cost of any kind being distributed by CXND.
Total Tokens Required for Proposal:
The figures presented are implied based on an assumption of increasing the Discord membership to 1,000 (with embedded assumption that each new added Discord member will have a minted NFT), which implies a new member count of ~720.  Additionally, there is a further assumption that each new member will have only achieved 1 POAP.
New Members: 72,000 $CXN Tokens
Existing Members earning POAPs (assumed 10 CXND members): 1,600 $CXN Tokens
Cross Country Tour Referral Bonus (720 new members are referred by an existing member): 18,000 $CXN Tokens
Cash Prize Incentive Tokens: 1,000 $CXN Tokens  
Variance Pool: 50,000 $CXN Tokens
The figures are estimated with any balance of $CXN Tokens not distributed being canceled at the end of the Cross Country Tour.
Given the short time frame to execute, Constellation Fund (CXNF) intends to backstop the total $CXN tokens required at this point in time. Upon approval by CXND members of this proposal, any $CXN tokens distributed shall be reimbursed by CXND to CXNF.

### Plan & Timeline

The Cross Country Tour, issuance of POAPs, and live engagement of existing and potential future CXND members is already in progress and will move according to the schedule below. 
Beginning: October 31, 2022 (the start date of the Cross Country Tour)
End: November 19, 2022 (the end date of the Cross Country Tour)
The distribution of $CXN tokens to new & existing CXND members will happen within 30 calendar days of the end of the Cross Country Tour noted above. Following distribution, the number of $CXN tokens sent by CXNF will be accounted & reimbursed by CXND within 14 calendar days. This amount of $CXN tokens will be approved by the Treasury Committee. The Programs Committee will additionally approve the validation of the POAP distribution according to live events that occurred and should fall under this incentive reward. 
### Dependencies
There are technological and partner interdependencies with Origami that need to be worked out to ensure smooth onboarding. However, there Cash Prize Incentive is meant to increase conversion as new members would be incentivized to fully onboard, despite any technological complications
Tracking of the refer-and-earn model is still being formulated, and will require a manual process (e.g. not a referral code type model) to ensure proper tracking. 
### Rationale

The rationale of the overall proposal is focused on growing membership and enhancing engagement of CXND. Initially, the goal of the Cross Country Tour was to focus on fundraising efforts related to CXNF, but morphed to also include CXND and membership growth. The key thesis being that stronger CXND numbers and results ultimately leads to the benefit of the CXNF process.

### Risks
-        Immediate:
Failure to deliver Cash Prize Incentive would result in reputational damage to CXND. This is mitigated as certain members have back-stopped the amount and there is no reliance on further participation of any other CXND members.
Quality of newly onboarded members is unknown at the time from the perspective on their intentions (e.g. just want the cash prize). While not a slam dunk, being able to provide immediate engagement channels and member connections would improve retention & attention to CXND . Furthermore, there is also an implied assumption that a larger membership base will assist in inthe larger the membership base, it assists in marketing efforts by CXND to external parties (whether PR and/or to potential partners).
-        Medium/Long Term:
Further means of engagement are required to ensure that existing and new members of CXND continue to participate and contribute. This is an issue that requires further exploration and is outside of the scope of this proposal, but is mentioned here as a reminder for all members.
