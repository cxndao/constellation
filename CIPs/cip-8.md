## Overview

This Constellation DAO (CXND) improvement proposal outlines the requirements and process of a merger between CXND and Lime DAO. Core contributors of both DAOs have been in discussions since March 2023 and require input from members to proceed any further.

## Background & Motivation

CXND has stagnated and has yet to launch a successful or ongoing initiative despite best efforts. Through content creation, a social media presence, and casual in-person events, the community has sustained a “Minimal Viable DAO.” It is time to sharpen the DAO's Purpose & Mission and generate momentum, or disband and focus attention elsewhere. Likewise, Lime DAO has experienced a significant decline in community engagement resulting from its challenges in launching an initiative. 

Core Contributors of both DAOs opine that a merger between them can revitalize the communities, and the combined resources are a sufficient catalyst for launching initiatives that will drive community engagement, revenue generation, and brand awareness.

### Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

- Revitalize the membership of both DAOs to create a vibrant Techstars Alum presence in Web3.
- Create a platform with a shared culture for builders to share ideas and resources to experiment in Web3.
- Develop novel funding mechanisms for startups utilizing web3 technologies.
- Find a sustainable business model for the DAO.

**Non-goals**

- Develop an organization that competes directly with Techstars.
- Create an organization that is overly extractive from startups.
- Pursue a business model that is overly dependent on external funding to get started.

### Plan & Timeline

1. We start new / from scratch as a merged DAO between Constellation and Lime with a new organization.
2. Any member of Lime & Constellation can join the new DAO.
3. We will keep the Constellation Brand.
4. We will setup a new soul-bound NFT that can be minted by CXN NFT and Lime NFT holders.
5. The new NFT will be used to gate access to the community.
6. We will set up a new governance system and legal entity, and any token that will be required, going forward by using one person, one vote (through the new NFT). The governance model will be tailored to the needs of the new DAO structure including the main DAO as well as each sub-DAO or sub-organization, ensuring that the appropriate framework is in place for the products/services offered. Ongoing detailed Discussions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mCFysEsLbFAcdpUNhiEKw4hhy8lESKFFaTagH_TGv3U/edit?usp=sharing). Document also listed in Appendix. 
7. To find a quorum with the Soulbound NFT the merged DAO will start with a >25% vote which can be changed by a vote itself. 
We do not have all the answers yet, but by instating the new DAO with a temporary governance model through the NFTs we commit to work on the larger questions without having to rush them. That way we can take our time as a merged community and consider the best options thoroughly before making decisions.

### Dependencies

1. Discord

  - The initial phase will primarily utilize the Constellation Discord Server for communications.
We will evaluate alternatives such as Bonfire.xyz, Console.xyz, and others.

2. Social Media

  - We will continue to utilize [@cxndao on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cxndao) and ["constellationdao" on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/constellationdao/).
  - We will pursue similar handles in platforms such as [lenster.xyz](lenster.xyz), [mirror.xyz](mirror.xyz), [buildcities.network](https://www.buildcities.network/), and others.

3. External Stakeholders (SAFT Holders & Origami)

  - We want to bring all existing stakeholders along in a fair and equitable manner. This will take 1:1 conversations to ensure the best future for the new DAO but has the express goal of finding the fairest solution for all.

4. DAO Tooling - TBD

  - We will immediately form working groups to explore alternative practices and solutions.

### Rationale

The rationale behind the merger proposal is to address the stagnation and lack of successful initiatives in Constellation DAO and Lime DAO. By merging the two entities, we will increase the size of our DAO's critical mass, leverage the unique resources in each existing DAO, and utilize the current brand awareness we have already built. The current lifecycle of DAOs is typically short due to the rapid change in governance models, technolgy, and utility of the DAO framework. This allows both DAOs the chance to succeed by taking the best of what each can provide. 

### Risks?

There are a myriad of risks:

- The members could fail to select a mutually agreeable governance model.
- Initiatives could fail to gain traction.
- The shifting regulatory landscape could deem some activities illegal.
- Most DAOs fail to sustain their activities.
